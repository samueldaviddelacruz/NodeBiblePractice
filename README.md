# NodeBiblePractice

Just a little project to put in practice my knowledge of Node.js ,the Express.js Framework
and a bit of mongo Db.

before starting

$ npm install

then on the data/database.js file replace mongoUrl with your own mongo instance credentials

it might look like this on the database.js file

var mongoUrl = "mongodb://yourusername:yourpassword@yourmongoinstance:port/yourdb";

once everything is set

$ node server.js

and proceed to localhost:3500
